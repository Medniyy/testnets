# Additional tasks 

## For validators
*These tasks aren't mandatory but feel free to do it if you can! There are some examples of contributions you could try to do but don't be scary to use your own creativity!*

### 1. *Run chain explorer* <br/>
You could run your own explorer for the Neutron chain. It could include some features that we Neutron will use in mainnet phase such as smart-contracts count and so on.

### 2. *Run alerting bots* <br/>
There you could do all to prepare the ground for the upcoming mainnet. Validators and participants should know about governance proposals, validator's activity etc.

### 3. *Make a video about Neutron* <br/>
In this task feel free to express yourself! Tell to community about the Neutron for example: <br/>
